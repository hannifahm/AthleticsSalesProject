# Athletics Sales Project

SQL Data Analysis Project | **May 2023**

_This project analyses the sales performance of a sports retail company._

## Background Information

The dataset was from a previous assignment I had done back in university. I decided to revisit the project with the new skills I had learned to replicate and improve my analysis. The original project was completed using Excel, and the revised project was completed using SQL and Tableau.

## Findings

SM-Athletics sales amounted to $10.14m for the year, with a gross profit of $1.3m. Over 20,000 orders were recorded and over 100,000 items sold. The disparity between sales and gross profit may be explained by incorrect or missing data.

Sales are more widespread in the regions of Europe and North America where the top countries in sales,France and Mexico contribute to $1.26m and $1.18m espectively. However, 55% of shipments are late, particularly in the aforementioned regions. 

A little over half of sales came from consumers, 30% from corporate sales and the remaining 18% of sales came from the home office. Majority of sales came from the Fan Shop and Apparel while the product families Book Shop, Pet Shop, Health & Beauty, Discs Shop and Fitness barely make 4% of total sales.
